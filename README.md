# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Clarice! I'm a 2nd year industrial engineering student attending at T.I.P. If there's one thing anybody knows about me, it's that I love cats, I have three of them and all of them are boys. One interesting fact about me is that I highly depend on the vibe and energy that a person is giving me, that is how I view them. I wouldn't call myself as someone who is socially active, I do hang out with my friends, I think I'm being myself more when I'm with them- the people I'm comfy with. However I do enjoy my alone time, I like going on walks alone and thinking about life in general. I'm new here, so I don't really know what to expect. And I'm not that artistic nor creativer either, so, I apologize for my poorly decorated profile, lol. If you'd like to be friends with me or get to know more aboput me, you can contact me on gmail, my account is qc-alob@tip.edu.ph, my facebook is Clarice Alob, and my instagram is @boomandabaam. I'd like to learn more about this website, it's what I'm here for, what about you?

Since this is the last meeting for this year, and probably the last time I'll be editing my read me, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
