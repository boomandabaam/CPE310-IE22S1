# ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Clarice! I'm a 2nd year industrial engineering student attending at T.I.P. If there's one thing anybody knows about me, it's that I love cats, I have three of them and all of them are boys. One interesting fact about me is that I highly depend on the vibe and energy that a person is giving me, that is how I view them. I wouldn't call myself as someone who is socially active, I do hang out with my friends, I think I'm being myself more when I'm with them- the people I'm comfy with. However I do enjoy my alone time, I like going on walks alone and thinking about life in general. I'm new here, so I don't really know what to expect. And I'm not that artistic nor creativer either, so, I apologize for my poorly decorated profile, lol. If you'd like to be friends with me or get to know more aboput me, you can contact me on gmail, my account is qc-alob@tip.edu.ph, my facebook is Clarice Alob, and my instagram is @boomandabaam. I'd like to learn more about this website, it's what I'm here for, what about you?

# EXPECTATION
I'm not new to coding, I took ITE 001A last semester, we used C++ and it was challenging for almost all of us, but in the end, we all had fun with our own struggles and how we mde our own efforts to survive the class. For this course, I'm hoping to add some new programming skills and use them well in my field. Us industrial engineerings handle data, that's not new and we need to be able to analyze them, give meaning to them, and know how and when to use them. I'm really looking forward on how this course is going to widen my skills in programming, decision making skills and of course being able to adapt and survive the class. My ITE 001 class was really fun for me, so I expect the same for this class. I hope we can all pick up soome new skills while having some fun! And since this is the last meeting for this year, and probably the last time I'll be editing my read me, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! (I'd probably remove the holidays part next year, if and when I remember to do it, lol).
